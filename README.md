first we designed a HTML page to give structure to our web page in file name index.html<br>
here we define a "div" of class shadow to give shadow effect<br>
In nested of shadow "div" we created a new box of "heading" class where we fefine our netflix logo and 2 buttons<br>
then in nested of shadow we created another "div" of class name as "main" where our text content is present such as "h1" "p" tags\

now com to our CSS part:<br>
first we give our background a image using background property inside body selector and set margin at 0 so no margin occurs around our body..because by default a webpage has its some margins<br>
result shown below\

as you can see our background is a clear image without any effect but in our give assignment there is a shadow effect<br>
for that effect we give our shadow class "div" a background color of black with alpha value of 0.7 to give pacity to the colour<br>
and give height of 100vh so it will cover our full webpage\

now our background looks exactly similar<br>
so now adust our "heading" class "div"<br>
we give height of our heading div 20% of our shadow class "div" because parent of heading is our "shadow" class "div"<br>
and set display property at value of "flex"
By using display flex in parent element, child elements automatically align like column or row with auto width and auto height\

in our heading "div" we created two nested "div" of class "image" and "buttons"<br>
first come to the "image" class and adjust our netflix logo at correct position<br>
give 40% of parent "div" as a width to the "image" class "div" , display property sets at value flex, we give padding  to 30px and<br>
justify-content: center<br>
The justify-content property aligns the flexible container's items when the items do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally)\

so our logo comes at exact similar positin<br>
now we have to adjust out buttons position<br>
we gave remaining width of parent class "shadow" to the button class "div" by setting property width 60%<br>
pading 60%<br>
and text-align: right to shift all the buttons to the right\
![image](https://github.com/Mayankkatheriya/Netflix_CSS/assets/128832286/e85dd22b-a949-4768-92e5-344b7d0dd871)

we set the correct postion to the buttons\
but buttons looks completely different, so lets give them similar looks
choosing selector of class "signin" 
giving background color red\
pedding: 8px 14px to adjust padding top/bottom and left/right\
color: white to give white color to text\
fonr-size: to adjust sixe of the font\
font weight: to give some effect to the our text\
and border radius for the round corners of the buttons\

now our heading set all set\
come to our next parent div of class "main"\
give width of 80% to this div\
display: flex to align items row-wise of column-wise\
flex-direction because we need to set our items in column wise\
justify-content to set our items at center horizontally\
align-items: to set out items at center vertically\

now in selector h1:\
set font-size for increase the size of h1\
and margin at 0\
